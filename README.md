# NoteTaker

## Description 
Have you ever needed to write down notes but your handwriting is god awful? Simply writing on your arm isn't good enough? Have you ever been unable to find a pen and paper for a quick note? Well I have created an application to solve all of these problems. This easy to navigate note taker app will be there for you even if you end up closing out of the screen. You can review your notes for later use anytime you want. Just click the "Get Started" button and you will be taken to the note taker screen. Just type in a title and the body of the note and click save!
